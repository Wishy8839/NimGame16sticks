# PYNimProject2023
Nim project I got tasked to make there was an option to work with someone else with I took. I don't really know how to win nim 100% of the time and so I only made it so that if theres a clear path for example 4 sticks and its the computer turn it'll take 3 and you'll lose.
if you wanna contact me about this my discord is Wishy#8839
